  @function
  
  In asynchronous platforms, this method will invoke the passed function with
  a callback and then block until the callback is called.  This allows you to
  make async operations run synchronously and visa-versa.

  This method will throw an exception if used on platforms that can't support
  it.
  
  @param {Function} callback
    The callback to invoke.  Should take a single parameter which is another
    function to invoke when the async action has completed.  Pass an optional
    error and return value.
    
  @param {Object} context
    Optional context to use when invoking callback
    
  @returns {Object} return value, if passed, from callback
