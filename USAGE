h2. Using Seed in your JS project

In your main.js file, require seed then require any other packages you might 
need.

---> main.js
#!/usr/bin/which seed

Hello = seed.require('hello'); // loads the hello package
Hello.world();

---

Then from the command line:

seed init

== API

seed.require('package:module', 'version');

requires a given package/module matching the specified version info.  You can
also use the import directive:

"import package:module >= 1.0";

This will load the named package/module and automatically define it in the 
current scope.  Import directives are processed at the time the module is 
loaded.
